Step 1: have a rail already built
Step 2: Check alignment of the rail - put down a reactor and a seat on the rail, see the "artificial horizon" view to check angles (roll and pitch) of the rail
To adjust for planets curvature, I use two (three) things:1) Prefabs of slope-up, slope-down to adjust the slope in like 0.5 deg increments
2) Put a rotor on the end of the rail, then put a rail after it, add a seat on it. Adjust the rotors velocity with left-right arrow keys (right-click on the velocity slider to reset it & make it active so you can left-right arrow giving it very small velocity to adjust angles very precisely) to make roll 0 again
3) When I need a very fine slope/make it perfectly level, do same, except adjust rotors on the slope-up or slope-down prefab
Just gotta remember to turn the whole thing from a ship to a station once you're done aligning - before you remove any rotors and other temporary connections
Basically use a control seat to check angles
So left-right leaning rails are made uniquely each time, but slope up and slope down are usually prefabs
When using the horizon, don't look at the horizon line
Instead look at how the grid aligns with the edges of the screen
It's much more precise when you match up all dots to be aligned with the screen edges
You can make tracks always perfectly aligned with the planets curvature this way
