Ingredients:
    * Tricolore Fusilli
    * Sauce:
        Mix
        * Tomato puree
        * Garlic puree
        * Fried, diced red peppers, yellow peppers and onion.
        * Coconut milk/cream (optional)
        * Black pepper
        * Salt
    * Cheese of your preference, I used mozzarella and mature cheddar, preferably home-grated but pre-grated is fine.
    * Butter.
    * Toppings that can be steamed and grilled/broiled, may need to be cooked in advance, I didn't use any in this.

Cooking:
    * Boil pasta until perfection (typically 10-12 minutes, I do 10 as I'll be cooking it on a pan for an additional few minutes), optionally add enough salt while boiling so you won't need to salt at all later, taste the pasta a few times.
    * Drain
    * Bring a pan to medium heat, add small amount of butter and add your sauce once the butter has melted.
    * Add the tricolore fusilli, mix until simmering.
        Note: This mixture shouldn't be runny, if it's runny you may have to drain some of the sauce, though it should definitely be saucy.
    * Once simmering, reduce heat, add grated cheese, toppings, herbs and spices, spreading everything evenly and covering the pan with a lid.
    * Steam until the cheese is starting to melt, take it off the heat and remove the lid.
    * Put the pan under a grill/broiler to crisp up the top layer of the pasta and the cheese (under constant supervision)
    * Top with any extra herbs and spices of your choice.
    * Transfer onto a large dish or pasta bowl and serve.
